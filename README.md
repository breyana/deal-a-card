# deal-a-card
An app that sends a random card when a user types '/deal' in Slack

## Usage
- Create an app in Slack (https://api.slack.com/apps)
- Create a new Slash Command (I recommend "/deal")
- Use https://deal-a-card-on-slack.herokuapp.com/deal for the request URL
- Install your app to your workspace
- In your Slack, type the slash command you've created!

## More Information
Making a post request to the /deal route sends JSON as a response. The JSON contains "text" for the Slack message and an "image_url" in "attachments" that is randomly generated by selecting a card 2 through K and a suit (C, D, S, H). 
The app is using the request's protocol and hostname to create the image URL for the hosted images. 
The card images are from http://acbl.mybigcommerce.com/52-playing-cards/
